Date started: Mar.31; Date finished: April.3
I spent approximately five hours on this assignment.

I did not consult anyone when doing this assignment.
Online reference: javadocs

I think the recitation on Friday about this assignment and recursive backtracking really helped with this assignment
as well as a general understanding of recursive backtracking algorithm.


I enjoyed doing this assignment because it applies what we learned in class to implementing an interesting game. :)
