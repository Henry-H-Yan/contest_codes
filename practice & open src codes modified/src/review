  findRobot: O(N), linear scan
  findInSorted : binary search  log(N)
  
  Nlog(N):mergesort
  BSTContainsValue:    (balanced??   unbalanced???)
  
  runtime= rt of recursive call+ rt of rest
  
  T(n):  
  recur call: same algo with different inputs,
  
  recursive relations
  T(n) =T(n/2) +o(1) ** when tree is BALANCED
